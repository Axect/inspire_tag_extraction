# INSPIRE Tag Extraction

This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating how to extract research tags (e.g., `hep-th`) from [INSPIRE HEP](https://inspirehep.net/) pages using **Selenium**. Because INSPIRE pages are dynamically rendered (JavaScript-based), traditional HTTP requests and parsing (e.g., `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`) will not reliably retrieve the DOM elements. Instead, we use Selenium to render pages and parse the final DOM.

## Google Sheets

The Google Sheet linked below presents the [2025 HEP Theory Postdoc Rumor Mill](https://sites.google.com/site/postdocrumor/) data after being processed through our bulk CSV parsing script. In particular, each entry in the rumor mill (e.g., a candidate, their institution, and acceptance status) has been enhanced with a new column, "Area," which reflects the research tag (such as hep-th, hep-ph, etc.) retrieved from the candidateâ€™s INSPIRE profile.

## Overview of Scripts

1. **Bulk CSV Parsing (`bulk_csv_parser.py`)**  
   - Reads a CSV file containing one or more INSPIRE links (in a column called `"Inspire link"`).  
   - Uses Selenium to visit each link, extracts the `Area` (i.e., the tag like `hep-th`) and adds it as a new column (`Area`).  
   - Outputs a new CSV file appending `"_with_area"` to the original file's name.

2. **Interactive Tag Parser (`interactive_parser.py`)**  
   - Runs in a loop, asking the user to input an INSPIRE link.  
   - Attempts to extract and print the research tag.  
   - Exits on certain commands (`quit`, `q`, or `exit`).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** (or a version that supports Selenium well)
- **Google Chrome** installed
- **ChromeDriver** (matching your installed Chrome version) in your system PATH or placed in a known location
- Python packages:
  - [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
  - [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
  - [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/) (optional, used for progress bars in the CSV script)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Axect/INSPIRE-Tag-Extraction
   cd INSPIRE-Tag-Extraction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment via uv** (recommended):
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   uv pip sync requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   uv pip install pandas selenium tqdm
   ```

4. **Install ChromeDriver**:  
   - Download **ChromeDriver** that matches your installed Google Chrome version from [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).  
   - Make sure it is placed in your system PATH or in the same directory as the scripts.

## Usage

### Script 1: Bulk CSV Parsing

**File**: `bulk_csv_parser.py`

**Description**: This script reads an input CSV, visits each "Inspire link" row, extracts the tag, and writes a new CSV with an added `Area` column.

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python bulk_csv_parser.py --csv path/to/input.csv
   ```
2. **What it does**:
   - It will open the CSV specified by `--csv`.
   - For each row, it extracts the tag from the provided `Inspire link`.
   - A new file (with `_with_area.csv` appended to the base name) will be created.

Example:
```bash
python bulk_csv_parser.py --csv "inspire_authors.csv"
# Creates "inspire_authors_with_area.csv"
```

### Script 2: Interactive Tag Parser

**File**: `interactive_parser.py`

**Description**: This script opens a headless Chrome browser and interactively prompts the user to input INSPIRE links one at a time.

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python interactive_parser.py
   ```
2. **What it does**:
   - A loop prompts you to enter an INSPIRE link. 
   - Once you enter the link, the script attempts to load the page, extract the `<span class="ant-tag __UnclickableTag__">` text, and print it on the console.
   - Type `quit`, `q`, or `exit` to stop.

## Additional Notes

- If ChromeDriver cannot be found, you may need to specify the path explicitly. For example:
  ```python
  driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="/path/to/chromedriver", options=chrome_options)
  ```
- If you encounter any issues with dynamic rendering delays, consider increasing the timeout in `WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=XX)`.
- The `tqdm` library is used in the CSV script to show progress bars. If you prefer, you can remove it or adjust the code to use standard print statements.
